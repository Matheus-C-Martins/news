# Local Development Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local (which is git-ignored)
# This file is ONLY used during local development with `npm run serve`

# Always-Proxy Configuration
# The app always uses a proxy, both locally and in production

# Option 1: Use deployed Vercel proxy (recommended for testing production behavior)
VUE_APP_VERCEL_API_URL=https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api

# Option 2: Use local proxy (set proxy to /api and configure Vite proxy)
# VUE_APP_VERCEL_API_URL=/api

# Optional: Set to 'development' to enable extra console logging
VITE_ENV_DEBUG=false

# NOTE: API key is NO LONGER needed here
# It's now only used by the backend proxy
# The proxy server should have NEWSAPI_KEY in its environment variables
