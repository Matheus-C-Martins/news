# Production Environment Variables (GitHub Pages)
# These are set via GitHub Actions Secrets, NOT .env files
# This file is documentation only - showing what GitHub Actions injects

# GitHub Actions will inject these from repository Secrets:
# Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

# IMPORTANT: For GitHub Pages deployment, you MUST use a proxy to hide your API key
# The browser should NEVER have direct access to your NewsAPI key

# Your NewsAPI.org API Key
# Injected by: secrets.VUE_APP_NEWS_API_KEY in GitHub Actions
# For GitHub Pages, this is used by your backend proxy only
VUE_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here

# Backend Proxy URL (REQUIRED for GitHub Pages)
# Injected by: secrets.VUE_APP_VERCEL_API_URL in GitHub Actions
# This should point to your backend service that proxies requests to NewsAPI
# Examples:
#   - https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/api
#   - https://your-railway.railway.app/api
#   - https://your-backend.herokuapp.com/api
# 
# The proxy will:
#   1. Receive requests from the browser (no API key)
#   2. Add your API key internally
#   3. Call NewsAPI server-to-server (safe)
#   4. Return results to browser
VUE_APP_VERCEL_API_URL=https://your-backend-proxy-url-here.vercel.app/api
