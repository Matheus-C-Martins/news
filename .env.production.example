# Production Environment Variables
# These should be set in your deployment environment (Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
# DO NOT commit actual values to version control

# For GitHub Pages deployment:
# 1. Go to your repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions
# 2. Add these secrets:
#    - VITE_VERCEL_API_URL (your deployed Vercel proxy URL)
#    - NEWS_API_KEY (for the proxy backend)

# Vercel Proxy URL (REQUIRED for production)
# This should point to your deployed Vercel proxy
# Example: https://your-news-proxy.vercel.app/api
VITE_VERCEL_API_URL=https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api

# Note: VITE_NEWS_API_KEY should NOT be set in production frontend
# The API key should only be configured in your backend proxy
# This keeps your API key secure and hidden from the client

# Additional Notes:
# - For Vercel deployment: Set these in Project Settings -> Environment Variables
# - For GitHub Pages: Set VITE_VERCEL_API_URL in GitHub Secrets
# - The proxy backend should have NEWS_API_KEY configured separately
# - Never expose your API key in the frontend build
